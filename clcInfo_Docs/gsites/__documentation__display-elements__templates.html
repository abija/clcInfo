<p class="t1">Templates are used to allow different elements and layouts for each of your talent builds. The first setting and the most important one for a template is assigning a spec to it: expand the Templates button in the left menu, select the template you want then go to the General tab in the right pane. The spec is defined by the primary tree and a distinctive talent (specified by the tree, rank and the amount of points you spent in that talent).</p>
<p class="t1">In order to determine which spec is active the addon will check the template starting with the topmost one. If it finds the primary tree and distinctive talent rank match the one in your current build that template will become active and the search will stop. </p>
<p class="t1">Once the template is active you can make changes to it. Extra template settings are accessed by clicking on "Active: Template", the topmost link in the left menu. </p>
<p class="t1">Here you can lock/unlock all elements in the template and decide when to show it.</p>
