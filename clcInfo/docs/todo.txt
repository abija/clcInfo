- deleting object is backwards
	- should be done by the mod not the object
	
- active template skinning options moved to respective elements global





- more accurate lbf support for icons
- better default skin?

-- modify the way grids are moved / saved ?


- bprint system is retarded, fix !!!

!!! some better way to handle stack font string

!!!!!!! add option to run stuff after return


aditional forms of display to keep in mind:
- sliding buttons: has a list of stuff to track, expands in 1 direction when more stuff should be displayed
- bars

- eventually have needed clcbpt features work?

!!! make sure that cIcon is the one we want, check for threading problems


-- make a system based on addon version to fix the db at first run after a new version comes out?
