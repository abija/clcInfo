- class module db -> based on template not global ?
- try a better way to structure updates for options and in general?

- lib include for buttonfacade ????


- implement that db fix for module options too ?

- manual select active template
- copy template settings ? (copy table)

- make group elements for sliders buttons?

- fix frame levels
- alert system
- an external addon that plugs into it to see what needs to be done there
-- remove more static stuff to allow display plugins and other custom stuff (all interaction with main module being done through registered functions)
|_ in other words, more oop?

- deleting object is backwards (should be done by the mod not the object)
	
- active template skinning options moved to respective elements global
- way to copy settings from bar advanced (even between templates/chars)
- gradients, flash for bars
- vertical bars? :p



- function to cleanup unused vars from db somehow

- modify the way unlock shows for icons
- better stack display?



- more accurate lbf support for icons
- better default skin?

-- modify the way grids are moved / saved ?


- bprint system is retarded, fix !!!

!!! some better way to handle stack font string

!!!!!!! add option to run stuff after return


aditional forms of display to keep in mind:
- sliding buttons: has a list of stuff to track, expands in 1 direction when more stuff should be displayed
- bars
- sliding bars
- eventually have needed clcbpt features work?

!!! make sure that cIcon is the one we want, check for threading problems


-- make a system based on addon version to fix the db at first run after a new version comes out?

-- for icons, make that buff/spell combo into a function



data types:
- list of auras
- list of stuff in general?
