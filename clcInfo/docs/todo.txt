- effects on the elements themselves?
- stop updating cooldowns when not needed on icons to let omnicc flash


- enabled/ranged improved?
- on class modules, make sure spells are checked since spec might not be guaranteed due to enforce (get tv cd on holy template etc)

- try a better way to structure updates for options and in general?

- implement that db fix for module options too ?

- copy template settings ? (copy table)

- alert system
- an external addon that plugs into it to see what needs to be done there
-- remove more static stuff to allow display plugins and other custom stuff (all interaction with main module being done through registered functions)
|_ in other words, more oop?

- deleting object is backwards (should be done by the mod not the object)
	
- way to copy settings from bar advanced (even between templates/chars)
- gradients, flash for bars
- vertical bars? :p

- function to cleanup unused vars from db somehow

- better stack display for icons
- more accurate lbf support for icons
- better default skin?


- add option to run stuff after return ?

! make sure that ___e is the one we want, check for threading problems
