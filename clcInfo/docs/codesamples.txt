Is it possible to add icons that show up if certain events happen?
For example to show Hand of Freedom when you are snared/rooted, Hand of Salvation if you pull aggro or similiar events? 



local _, status = UnitDetailedThreatSituation("player", "target")
if status and status > 1 then
	return "threat"
end
