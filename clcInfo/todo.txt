- show/hide all elements according to target/combat and all the other bullshit
- better display customization for icons
- more lbf support
-- better default skin?

-- modify the way grids are moved / saved ?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fix all the : . self bullshit
!!! remove the extra textures and just put a black one for icons? (last awake decision: no)

- lock/unlock added to each element


- bprint system is retarded, fix !!!

!!! some better way to handle stack font string


!!! oor = red, oop = blue, other = gray

!!!!!!! add option to run stuff after return
!!!!!!!! when template changes, make sure before you do that, all the icons have ExecCleanup run if it's available


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! find a fix for:
if not clcInfo.classModules then clcInfo.classModules = {} end
if not clcInfo.classModules.paladin then clcInfo.classModules.paladin = {} end
if not clcInfo.classModules.paladin.retribution then ....


aditional forms of display to keep in mind:
- sliding buttons: has a list of stuff to track, expands in 1 direction when more stuff should be displayed
- bars
- sliding bars

!!! make sure that cIcon is the one we want, check for threading problems
